# AgriConnect

AgriConnect is a social, learning, and gamified digital platform designed for farmers, especially in Kerala. It helps farmers learn sustainable farming practices, share real farming experiences, and stay updated with agricultural news and government policies in simple English and Malayalam.

## Problem Statement

Many farmers continue to rely on unsustainable farming practices due to habit, lack of engaging training methods, limited access to updated agricultural knowledge, and difficulty understanding government policies. Traditional awareness programs are mostly one-directional and fail to create long-term behavioral change.

## Solution Overview

AgriConnect addresses this problem by converting agricultural learning into a social and rewarding experience. It combines community-driven knowledge sharing, crop-based learning, gamified farming tasks, and simplified policy updates into a single digital platform.

## Key Features

### Social Farming Community

Farmers can share photos, videos, and posts about their farming activities. Other users can like, comment, and learn from real field experiences.

### Crop-Based Learning

Farmers select a crop and receive curated YouTube playlists that explain sustainable farming practices in a step-by-step and visual manner.

### Gamified Tasks and Rewards

Farming activities are converted into tasks such as soil preparation, sowing, irrigation, and harvesting. Farmers upload photos or videos after completing tasks and earn points, badges, and leaderboard rankings.

### News and Policy Simplification

The platform provides simplified summaries of agricultural news, government schemes, and policies in English and Malayalam using AI-based summarization and translation.

### Profile and Progress Tracking

Each farmer has a profile that shows their crops, completed tasks, earned badges, and activity history, creating a digital farming portfolio.
